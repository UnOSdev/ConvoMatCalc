# ConvoMatCalc
This is a small implementation of the convolution proccess.

Built in Ubuntu Linux using *make* as a build system, and *gcc* as a compiler.
C2x (C23) C standart was used but should be fine down to C99.
- Run *make* in the terminal to build.
- Run *make run* in the terminal to build and run the program.
